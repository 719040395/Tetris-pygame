# Tetris - a Micro Pygame

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a Tetris game, providing players with the classic Tetris gaming experience. Tetris is a classic puzzle game where players control different shapes of blocks, called tetrominos, to move them vertically or rotate them to fill complete horizontal lines. When a line is completed, it disappears, and the player earns points. The game's difficulty increases as more lines are cleared, until the game area is filled, or the player cannot move the falling tetrominos anymore.



## How to operate?

- **Left and right movement control:** use the left and right direction keys of the keyboard to achieve(⬅)(➡️)
- **Rotation direction control:** use the up keys of the keyboard to achieve(⬆)
- **Fast fall control** use the down keys of the keyboard to achieve(⬇)



## Purpose of the software





## Development Plan

### Development Process

#### Phase One: Environment Setup and Basic Functionality Implementation

1. **Environment Setup**
   - *Download and install Python 3.x and set up a code editor.*
   - *Proper installation of Python and code editor is crucial for seamless development.*

2. **Pygame Configuration**
   - *Install and configure the Pygame library.*
   - *Pygame setup is essential for graphics and event handling.*

3. **Window Initialization**
   - *Initialize the game window with appropriate settings.*
   - *Proper window initialization ensures a smooth user interface.*

4. **Block Display**
   - *Implement rendering of different tetrominos.*
   - *Rendering blocks accurately is essential for gameplay.*

5. **Block Movement**
   - *Implement movement and rotation of tetrominos.*
   - *Smooth movement and rotation enhance player control.*

6. **Collision Detection**
   - *Implement collision detection between tetrominos.*
   - *Accurate collision detection ensures fair gameplay.*

7. **Line Clearing**
   - *Implement logic for clearing completed lines.*
   - *Line clearing is a core mechanic for scoring and progression.*



#### Phase Two: Game Functionality Enhancement and Optimization

1. **Tetromino Rotation Optimization**
   - *Improve rotation mechanics for tetrominos.*
   - *Smooth rotation enhances gameplay fluidity.*

2. **Game Interface Beautification**
   - *Enhance visual elements of the game interface.*
   - *A visually appealing interface improves user experience.*

3. **Sound Effects Addition**
   - *Integrate sound effects for game events.*
   - *Sound effects add immersion and feedback to gameplay.*

4. **Pause**
   - *Add functionality for pausing and saving the game state.*
   - *Pausing and saving improve user convenience.*

5. **User Interface Enhancement**
   - *Improve user interaction elements.*
   - *Clear instructions and intuitive controls enhance usability.*
